The kindness of these people are summed up on page 28, with the quote, \"Go with my blessing, Odysseus, and with a full sail. No need to row - only to keep a straight tiller and watch out for the shores of your homeland.\" They would seemingly get home in no time, due to the generosity of the Aeolians.\nNote: it is highly likely that Odysseus travelled around Sicily instead of going through the Strait of Messina because it is the real-life location for Charybdis and Scylla.
